# üå± t h r i v e - plant health monitor

### Created by Katelyn Wang and Kyle Reid
*Project in IoT (CS 147), Fall 2024*

An IoT system and application that collects soil moisture, temperature, and humidity data from your plant and notifies when your plant needs care.

## Architecture

![architecture drawio](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85116a8d-d5c2-4880-9c54-46394053c01f)


## Frontend
Contains the frontend code for the application, created with **React Native** and **Expo**.

### Setup
1. Navigate to the `Frontend/` directory and install dependencies for the app:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
2. **Change the server IP address** in `Frontend/constants.ts` to the IP address of where your server is hosted (ex. AWS instance public IP)

### To Run
In `Frontend/` start the React Native application on web or mobile:

   - **Web** - run the command below to open the app on `http://{FRONTEND_IP}:8081` with FRONTEND_IP as wherever you're running the app (ex. AWS instance IP or localhost): 
   ```
   npm run start
   ```
   - **Mobile** - download the Expo Go app on iOS or Android, run the command below in `Frontend/`, and scan the QR code in the terminal to open the app on your phone:
   ```
   npx expo start
   ```
   
## Server
An **Express.js** server that handles API requests for sensor data and data ranges.

### Setup
Navigate to the `Frontend/server` directory and install dependencies for the app
```
npm install
```

### To Run / Test
1. In a terminal where your server is hosted, navigate to `Frontend/server` and run the following to start the server on port 3000:
   ```
   node server.js
   ```
2. To test sending data, send a GET request in your browser using `http://{SERVER_IP}:3000/sensor-data?moisture=12&temperature=34&humidity=56` and check the React Native app to see if the values are displayed.

3. To test setting sensor ranges, send a POST request with min and max values for the different sensors:
   ```
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"moisture": { "min": "20", "max":"40"}, "temperature": {"min": "20", "max": "40"}, "humidity": {"min":"40", "max":"60"}}' http://{SERVER_IP}:3000/update-sensor-ranges
   ```

**NOTE**: Replace `{SERVER_IP}` with the the IP of where your server is hosted (ex. AWS instance or localhost).

## PlatformIO
Contains the embedded code for the hardware that collects soil moisture, temperature, and humidity data from the plant and lights up LEDs if the plant needs attention. Interacts with the server to send sensor data and get ideal sensor ranges.

### Code Setup
1. Write the SSID and password for your Wifi/hotspot to the ESP32.
2. Navigate to the `platformio/` project folder using the PlatformIO extention in VSCode.
3. Make sure the dependencies in platformio.ini are installed.
4. ‚ùó**Add the server's IP address to the code at the top of** `src/main.cpp`. 

### To Run
1. Build the project.
2. Upload to the ESP32.
3. Run the project (serial monitor).
