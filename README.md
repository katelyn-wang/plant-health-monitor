# THRIVE - The Plant Health Monitor

### Created by Katelyn Wang and Kyle Reid
*Project in IoT (CS 147), Fall 2024*

An IoT system and application that collects soil moisture, temperature, and humidity data from your plant and notifies when your plant needs care.

## Frontend
Contains the frontend code for the application. The app is created using **React Native** with an **Express.js** server.

### Setup
1. Navigate to the `Frontend/` folder.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependences for the **app**.
3. Navigate to the `Frontend/server` folder.
4. Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install dependencies for the **server**.
5. **Change the server IP address** in `Frontend/constants.ts` to the IP address of where your server is hosted (ex. AWS instance public IP)

### To Run
1. In `Frontend/` run this to start the React Native application on `http://{FRONTEND_IP}:8081` where FRONTEND_IP is wherever you're running the app (ex. AWS instance IP or localhost): 
   ```
   npm run start
   ```
2. In a separate terminal, navigate to `Frontend/server` and run this to start the server on port 3000:
   ```
   node server.js
   ```

3. To test sending data, send a GET request in your browser using `http://{SERVER_IP}:3000/sensor-data?moisture=12&temperature=34&humidity=56` and check the React Native app to see if the values are displayed.

4. To test setting sensor ranges, send a POST request with min and max values for the different sensors:
   ```
   curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"moisture": { "min": "20", "max":"40"}, "temperature": {"min": "20", "max": "40"}, "humidity": {"min":"40", "max":"60"}}' http://{SERVER_IP}:3000/update-sensor-ranges
   ```

NOTE: Replace `{SERVER_IP}` with the the IP of where your server is hosted (ex. AWS instance or localhost).

## PlatformIO
Contains the embedded code for the hardware that collects soil moisture, temperature, and humidity data from the plant and sends it to the server.

### Setup
1. Navigate to the `platformio/` folder.
2. Make sure the dependencies in platformio.ini are installed.
3. ‚ùó**Add the server's IP address to the code at the top of** `src/main.cpp`. 

### To Run
1. Build the project.
2. Upload to the ESP32.
3. Run the project (serial monitor).
